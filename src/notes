 I finally found what was causing those dll errors. After all of this time and after months of using this with those errors, I found it.

 def load_llmodel_library():
    ext = {"Darwin": "dylib", "Linux": "so", "Windows": "dll"}[platform.system()]

    try:
        # Try to load the library
        lib = ctypes.CDLL(str(MODEL_LIB_PATH / f"libllmodel.{ext}"))
    except (FileNotFoundError, OSError):
        if ext != 'dll':
            raise
        # Fallback to MSVC on Windows
        try:
            lib = ctypes.CDLL(str(MODEL_LIB_PATH / "llmodel.dll"))
        except (FileNotFoundError, OSError):
            print("Warning: Optional llmodel.dll not found. Proceeding without it.")
            return None  # Return None if the library is not found
    return lib

llmodel = load_llmodel_library()
